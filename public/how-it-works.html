        <h1>How it Works</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Input a Name:</strong> Enter the name of any <strong>business, landmark, or location</strong> you want to analyze into the search bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrape Reviews via Apify:</strong> The backend triggers an integrated <strong>Apify API</strong> call. Apify searches for the specified location on Google Maps and scrapes its reviews in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Classify Each Review:</strong> As reviews are collected, each one is passed through the Kaypoh Aunty classification engine.</li>
            <li><strong>View Results:</strong> The application displays the scraped reviews along with the labels assigned by the classifier, allowing for immediate analysis and filtering.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Classification Categories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertisements:</strong> Identifies promotional content.</li>
            <li><strong>Spam:</strong> Filters out undesirable or low-quality content.</li>
            <li><strong>Rant Without Visit:</strong> Catches feedback from users who may not have had a firsthand experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrelevant Content:</strong> Flags reviews that are nonsensical or do not contribute meaningful feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Useful Reviews:</strong> Recognizes detailed, helpful reviews that can inform business decisions or provide insights to other users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Classification Engine: A Two-Stage Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rule-Based Classification:</strong> A fast, rule-based classifier written in JavaScript runs first, catching obvious cases using predefined patterns and keywords.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Model Classification:</strong> If a review does not match any rules, it is sent to a fine-tuned DistilBERT model hosted on Hugging Face for nuanced analysis.</li>
        </ol>
